# Working with Christos, a fellow Web developer

Hey everyone :wave:, I‚Äôm really excited to be working with each of you and your teams. Here is a doc with few up-front things about my communication style, unique values and growth areas. I hope some of you find helpful!

## I‚Äôm here to help and support Sesame with frontend development and have a fruitful jurney with you all.

### Communication

Overall, I like more communication rather than less, especially now that most of us are remote.

- **Written vs verbal** :memo: :speech_balloon:

  Personally, I am in favour of a quick in-person sync to resolve something versus a long mail/thread exchange. However I might be clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk through my thoughts out loud, which can sometimes feel rambly or sound confusing. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify!

- **Emails** üìß

  I will read every email I get in a day but I don‚Äôt respond just so you know I read it‚ÄîI‚Äôll only respond if you ask me something directly or I have a question. Thus, assume I did read the email within 18 hours, but if you think I owe you a response please resend or ping me and I won‚Äôt be offended.

- **Chat/ping** :ping_pong:

  - If it‚Äôs urgent/impt/timely or super short feel free to ping any time, even when I am ‚Äúaway.‚Äù
  - Short questions on ping are fine but I might be inconsistent in response times since I am often in meetings.
  - If it‚Äôs a long topic and not time sensitive, perhaps we can jump into a quick call. 

- **Feedback** üó£Ô∏è

  I like it. I like to give it and I like to receive it, particularly constructive. On my side I will be trying to give you constructive, clear and timely feedback and hope that you‚Äôll give me the same. Having said that, any time you feel I could do something different, you can reach out to me directly. If you prefer anonymous feedback that is also fine, anonymous feedback is better than no feedback. 

  I believe that feedback requires three attributes:

  - **Safety** - you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback

  - **Effort** - neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback

  - **Benefit** - giving/receiving feedback should have impact

  Please let me know if I‚Äôm doing poorly on any of these attributes. I‚Äôll return the favor!

- **Debates**  -wip

  Sometimes having conficting conversations is nessesary to get the best of an idea or a concept. Now having said that, I am not a huge fun of drama and I am commited into having constructive conversations without having parties being hurt in the end

- **Social** :dancer:

  I like a good laugh and to have fun with the people I work with. You will also find that, I enjoy hanging out and get to know people personally. Even though I respsect people who try to separate personal and professional life, some of the best colleuges I had are now good friends outside of work.

- **Helping out**  üôã

  I like to help people whenever I can. So, if you think I can do anything to help out, let me know. It can be work related or even not! For example, I have helped countless times people move flats. It is a good exercise and I honestly think is good fun.

### Likes and dislikes

- **Motivation** :100:

  I want to believe that I am a good in keeping myself motivated. 

  What might break my "motivational castle" is 

  * an environment in which people are oparating under fear, shame or guilt. 
  * Having very limited autonomy. I believe that people closest to the problem should make decisions. Micromanagement is also a trigger.
  * Not having learned anything new for a loooong time.

- **Agreements** :handshake:

  * I personally try to keep my agreements and I also appreciate when people do the same. Of course keeping agreements cannot *always* be the case, but I try keeping a good record. When it comes to my attention that I cannot keep an agreement I will re-negotiate it with you.
  * Please don‚Äôt push me to commit into something immediately. I need time to process new information. I commit deliberately. If you want me to commit during a meeting, send me data beforehand.
  * You might hear ask, "who is gonna do what by when?". I think this short question helps with having clear agreements.

- **Ownership** :hand:

  - I honestly enjoy when people act with a sense of ownership. I am enjoying doing the same.
  - I default to doing quality work. That said, undestand that there might be expeptions in this rule. Please shout out if you see me doing the oposite!

### Learnings

I value learnings either it comes in a form of technical knowledge or in any other form. Last year I have been spening a lot of my time learning and doing some DevOps work. So please shout out if there is anything DevOps related you think I could help out with, would be more than keen to do so! Also I spent some time reading books, so please if you have any good suggestions I am happy to chat about that! 

## The end. If you read this far, I honestly thank you. 

Why don‚Äôt you shoot me a message? Would be happy to get to know of you :)
