# Working with Christos, a fellow Web developer :spider_web: :man_technologist:

Hey everyone :wave:, I’m really excited to be working with each of you and your teams. Here is a doc with few up-front things about my working style, unique values and growth areas. I hope some of you find helpful!

## I’m here to help and support Sesame with frontend development

### Communication

Overall, I like more communication rather than less, especially now that most of us are remote.

* **Written vs verbal** :memo: :speech_balloon:

  *  Personally, I am in favour of a quick in-person sync to resolve something versus a long mail/thread exchange. However I might be clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk through my thoughts out loud, which can sometimes feel rambly or sound confusing. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify!

* **Emails ** - WIP

  - I will read every email I get in a day but I don’t respond just so you know I read it—I’ll only respond if you ask me something directly or I have a question. Thus, assume I did read the email within 18 hours, but if you think I owe you a response please resend or ping me and I won’t be offended.
  - I *love* fyi emails when you send me something you saw, a customer anecdote, an article, some data, or something someone on your team did and if you write fyi in the subject or in the fwd I’ll know it’s for my information but *not* requiring response or urgent reading and I’ll do the same for you. FYI = no response required.

* **Chat/ping**

  - If it’s urgent/impt/timely or super short feel free to ping any time, even when I am “away.”
  - Short questions on ping are fine but I might be inconsistent in response times since I am often in meetings.
  - If it’s a long topic and not time sensitive, perhaps we can jump into a quick call. 

* **Feedback**

  I like it. I like to give it and I like to receive it, particularly constructive. On my side I will be trying to give you constructive, clear and timely feedback and hope that you’ll give me the same. Having said that, any time you feel I could do something different, you can reach out to me directly. If you prefer anonymous feedback that is also fine, anonymous feedback is better than no feedback. 

  I believe that feedback requires three attributes:

  - **Safety** - you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback

  - **Effort** - neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback

  - **Benefit** - giving/receiving feedback should have impact

  Please let me know if I’m doing poorly on any of these attributes. I’ll return the favor!

* **Debates** - WIP

  Sometimes having conficting conversations is nessesary to get the best of an idea or concept. Now having said that, I am not a huge fun of drama and I think we can have constructive conversations without [having parties feeling hurt in the end]

- **Social**

  I like a good laugh and to have fun with the people I work with. You will also find that, I enjoy hanging out and get to know people personally. Even though I respsect people who try to separate personal and professional life, some of the best colleuges I had are now good friends outside of work.

- **Helping out** 

  I like to help people whenever I can. So, if you think I can do anything for you, let me know. It can be work related or even not! For example, I have helped countless times people move flats. It is a good exercise and I honestly think is good fun.

### Likes and dislikes

* **Motivation**
  * I want to believe that I am a good in keeping myself motivated. What might break my motivational castle is an environment in which people are oparating under fear, shame or guilt.  
* **Agreements**
  * I personally try to keep my agreements. Which means, I also appreciate when people do the same. This of course can't always be the case but I try keeping a good record. Know that, If I wont be able to keep an agreement I will communicate it with you beforehands.

- **Ownership**
  - I appreciate when people work with a sense of ownership. I am enjoying doing the same.
  - I prefer doing quality work than fast half finished work. That said, I undestand that there might be expeptions in this rule, however for me personally the deafult would be quality on the work. Please shout out if you see me doing the oposite!
- **Transparency**
  * I love when people and organisations have a culture that encourages transparency. 

### Lernings

I value learnings either it comes to technical stuff or not. I spent the last learning a lot about the devops universe. So please shout out if there is anything I can help you with in this realm. Would be more than keen to do so!

### The end
If you read this far, you care! I thank you. Why don’t you shoot me an message? Would be happy to get to know more of the Sesame group :)
