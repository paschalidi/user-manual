# Working with Christos, a fellow Web developer

Hey everyone :wave:, I’m really excited to be working with each of you and your teams. Here is a doc with few up-front things about myself and my working style that I hope some of you find helpful.

## I’m here to help and support Sesame with frontend development

### Communication

Overall, I like more communication rather than less, especially now that most of us are remote.

* **Written vs verbal** 
  *  Personally, I am in favour of a quick in-person sync to resolve something versus a long mail/thread exchange. However I might be clearer in writing than in person. In person, I may talk through my thoughts out loud, which can sometimes feel rambly or sound confusing. If my point is not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify!

* **Emails**
  - I will read every email I get in a day but I don’t respond just so you know I read it—I’ll only respond if you ask me something directly or I have a question. Thus, assume I did read the email within 18 hours, but if you think I owe you a response please resend or ping me and I won’t be offended.
  - I *love* fyi emails when you send me something you saw, a customer anecdote, an article, some data, or something someone on your team did and if you write fyi in the subject or in the fwd I’ll know it’s for my information but *not* requiring response or urgent reading and I’ll do the same for you. FYI = no response required.
* **Chat/ping**
  - If it’s urgent/impt/timely or super short feel free to ping any time, even when I am “away.”
  - Short questions on ping are fine but I might be inconsistent in response times since I am often in meetings.
  - If it’s a long topic and not time sensitive, perhaps we can have a quick call. 

* **Feedback**

  I like it. I like to give it and I like to receive it, particularly constructive. On my side I will be trying to give you constructive, clear and timely feedback and hope that you’ll give me the same. Having said that, any time you feel I could do something different, you can reach out to me directly. If you prefer anonymous feedback that is also fine, anonymous feedback is better than no feedback. 

  I believe that feedback requires three attributes:

  - **Safety** - you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback

  - **Effort** - neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback

  - **Benefit** - giving/receiving feedback should have impact

  Please let me know if I’m doing poorly on any of these attributes. I’ll return the favor!

* **Debates** 

  Sometimes having conficting conversations is nessesary to get the best of an idea or concept. Now having said that, I am not a huge fun of drama and I think we can have constructive conversations without [having parties feeling hurt in the end]

- **Social**

  I like a good laugh and to have fun with the people I work with. You will also find that, I enjoy hanging out and get to know people personally. Even though I respsect people who try to separate personal and professional life, some of the best colleuges I had are now good friends outside of work.

- **Helping out** 

  I like to help people whenever I can. So, if you think I can do anything for you, let me know. I have helped countless times people move flats. It is a good exercise and I honestly enjoy it.

### VALUES

- **Team values** 

  I'll put the team's interests over my own interest. Even that means working extra hours to cover for teammates, doing boring works, etc. That's fine as long as the team succeeds.

### DEVELOPMENT STYLE

WIP: I will follow the teams conventions but sometimes I take time and suggest what _I_ would consider as "imrpovements".

* **Process and Software Development**

  I strongly believe in putting people over process and changing process to accommodate our needs and goals. I’ve worked with and without Agile, with and without a form of Scrum. At the end of the day, these are my values:

  * I value transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.
  * I value speed, including proactive efforts that keep us moving quickly (e.g. writing tests, refactoring legacy code before a new feature, pairing on work to improve our code quality and bus factor)
  * I value learning, and know that training up on a tech stack may not always be the fastest route to production.
  * I value your time and don’t want you to do any process that is neither beneficial to you nor required by law, policy, etc.

* **Relationships**

  I endeavor to have a great working relationship with you, and I would encourage you to have great working relationships with your peers and business partners (in the office and/or on your team), as well as other folks in other offices to get a sense of how things work outside of our team. I’m happy to make introductions for you or provide networking suggestions to help you do that.

* **Work quality**

  I am proud of my work (most of the time) and have a high standard for myself. So, I will try my best to deliver a good quality. In return, I’d expect the same. If you are overwhelmed with other things, let me know and we can work it out together.

* **I’m big on work/life balance**

  Most folks work between about 8am (at the earliest) to 6pm (at the latest), and unless there’s an emergency, I don’t expect to communicate with you outside of these hours with respect to your local time. I try not to respond to e-mails or slack during off-hours and **under no circumstances expect you to, unless it’s an emergency.**



If you read this far, you care! I thank you. Why don’t you shoot me an email? Coffee/beer are on me!
